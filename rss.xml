grand challenge with a ¬£20k prize pool bringing together students at 18 universities across the UK, the US and Canada to help
tackle climate change with AI.</strong> üåç</p><p>Students will be competing to develop state-of-the-art machine learning methods for more accurately
forecasting near-term site-level solar photovoltaic power generation using 600 gigabytes of
satellite imagery, weather forecasts and air quality forecasts.</p><p>The competition has been organised in collaboration with <a href="https://openclimatefix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Climate Fix</a>,
a non-profit lab focused on rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and is
supported this year by <a href="https://www.newcrosshealthcare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newcross Healthcare</a>, <a href="https://ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University College London</a>,
<a href="https://www.pgim.com/real-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGIM Real Estate</a> via their <a href="https://www.pgim.com/real-estate/realassetx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealAssetX</a> innovation lab, and <a href="https://www.climate-x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate X</a>.</p><p>Open Climate Fix estimate that more accurate solar power forecasting techniques could cut carbon
emissions by up to 100,000 tonnes per year in the UK alone ‚Äì and by up to 100 million tonnes per
year if deployed worldwide ‚Äì by allowing grid operators to reduce their use of non-renewable sources
to account for the variability of solar power generation.</p><p>Students have until Friday 8th March 2024 to make their final submission in the qualifying around,
and the top three students from each university will be invited to develop a joint solution and present
their work to a panel of expert judges at in-person finals simultaneously taking place at UCL and Harvard
University on Friday 5th and Saturday 6th April 2024.</p><p>The winning teams will be awarded ¬£10,000 (~$12.7k US), ¬£6,000 (~$7.6k US) and ¬£4,000 (~$5k US), respectively,
and their research contributions have the potential to be deployed by Open Climate Fix to produce more accurate
solar power forecasts for the UK‚Äôs National Grid Electricity System Operator.</p><p>When the competition ran for the first time as ClimateHack.AI 2022 between January and March 2022, the winning model
was the most accurate model for predicting cloud movements that Open Climate Fix had seen to date.</p><p><strong>Students interested in taking part should visit <a href="https://climatehack.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climatehack.ai</a>, check out the <a href="https://doxaai.com/competition/climatehackai-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">competition page</a> and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/HTTQ8AFjJp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community Discord server</a>.</strong></p><hr><p><em>Students may take part from the following universities: Bristol, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon University, Harvard University, Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Imperial College London, King's College London, Manchester, Michigan, Oxford, Princeton, St Andrews, Toronto, UC Berkeley, UCLA, University College London (UCL), Warwick and Waterloo.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
