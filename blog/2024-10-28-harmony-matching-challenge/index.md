Today, we are delighted to be launching the [Harmony Question Matching Challenge](https://doxaai.com/competition/harmony-matching) in support of the [Harmony](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/) project, which aims to develop a tool to help researchers make better use of existing data by _harmonising_ questionnaire items and measures across different studies&mdash;potentially in different languages&mdash;through an approach based on natural language processing (NLP).

Harmony is a collaboration between researchers at [Ulster University](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), the [Universidade Federal de Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br/) and [Fast Data Science](https://fastdatascience.com/). The Harmony project has been funded by [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/) as part of the [Wellcome Data Prize in Mental Health](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/wellcome-mental-health-data-prize) and by the [Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/).

The challenge is to develop an improved algorithm for matching psychology survey questions that produces similarity ratings more closely aligned with those given by humans psychologists working in the field and that can be integrated into the [Harmony tool](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/developer-guide/). This competition will last approximately two months and finish on 10th January at 5pm (GMT).

This competition will have the following prizes as Amazon vouchers:

- **First place**: £500
- **Second place**: £250

If you are interested in taking part, join the conversation on the [Harmony Discord](https://discord.com/invite/harmonydata) and the [DOXA AI Discord](https://discord.gg/MUvbQ3UYcf) servers.
