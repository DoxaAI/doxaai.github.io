The [Harmony](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/) team will now work with the winners to explore the integration of their solutions into the Harmony tool, which aims to help researchers make better use of existing data by _harmonising_ questionnaire items and measures across different studies using natural language processing.

Harmony is a collaboration between researchers at [Ulster University](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), the [Universidade Federal de Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br/) and [Fast Data Science](https://fastdatascience.com/). The Harmony project has been funded by [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/) as part of the [Wellcome Data Prize in Mental Health](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/wellcome-mental-health-data-prize) and by the [Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/).
