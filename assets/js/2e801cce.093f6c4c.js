at University College London and Harvard University this weekend, ClimateHack.AI 2023&ndash;24 has just finished, and the winners can be announced!** \ud83e\udd73\\r\\n\\r\\nOn behalf of ClimateHack.AI, I would like to massively congratulate (i) Areel, Carter and Trevor from the University of Waterloo (Canada); (ii) Andrew, Grace, Tim and Val from the University of California, Berkeley (United States); and (iii) Tom and Michael from the University of Bristol (United Kingdom). \ud83c\udfc6\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nClimateHack.AI 2023&ndash;24 launched on Monday 27th November 2023 with a challenge from [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org/) to build accurate, efficient machine learning models for solar power forecasting using 600+ gigabytes of satellite imagery, numerical weather predictions and air quality data.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne month ago, the top three eligible participants from each university at the end of the qualifying round were invited to form a team and jointly present their work at our in-person competition finals to a panel of expert judges, who selected the winning teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to our supporters &ndash; [Newcross Healthcare](https://www.newcrosshealthcare.com/), [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk/),\\r\\n[PGIM Real Estate](https://www.pgim.com/real-estate/) via their [RealAssetX](https://www.pgim.com/real-estate/realassetx) innovation lab, [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org/) and [Climate X](https://www.climate-x.com/) &ndash; ClimateHack.AI was able to fund finalists\' travel and accommodation for the event, ensuring that our top teams from universities in the UK, the US and Canada could meet in London and Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, 3,900+ machine learning models were submitted by participants to the [DOXA AI platform](https://doxaai.com/competition/climatehackai-2023) for evaluation throughout the competition, surpassing the 2,200+ satellite imagery forecasting models submitted during [ClimateHack.AI 2022](https://doxaai.com/competition/climatehackai-2022).\\r\\n\\r\\nOur winning teams will now share a prize pool of \xa320,000 (~\xa325,000), and their contributions &ndash; as well as those of our other finalists &ndash; will now feed into Open Climate Fix\'s open-source research to build better machine learning models for forecasting solar power generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey estimate that more accurate forecasts could allow grid operators to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100 kilotonnes of CO<sub>2e</sub> per year in Great Britain alone and on the order of 50 megatonnes per year worldwide by 2030.\\r\\n\\r\\n**You can find out more about the competition and machine learning challenge on the [ClimateHack.AI

together students at 18 universities across the UK, the US and Canada to help\\r\\ntackle climate change with AI.** \ud83c\udf0d\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents will be competing to develop state-of-the-art machine learning methods for more accurately\\r\\nforecasting near-term site-level solar photovoltaic power generation using 600 gigabytes of\\r\\nsatellite imagery, weather forecasts and air quality forecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe competition has been organised in collaboration with [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org/),\\r\\na non-profit lab focused on rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and is\\r\\nsupported this year by [Newcross Healthcare](https://www.newcrosshealthcare.com/), [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk/),\\r\\n[PGIM Real

--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen Climate Fix estimate that more accurate solar power forecasting techniques could cut carbon\\r\\nemissions by up to 100,000 tonnes per year in the UK alone \u2013 and by up to 100 million tonnes per\\r\\nyear if deployed worldwide \u2013 by allowing grid operators to reduce their use of non-renewable sources\\r\\nto account for the variability of solar power generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents have until Friday 8th March 2024 to make their final submission in the qualifying around,\\r\\nand the top three students from each university will be invited to develop a joint solution and present\\r\\ntheir work to a panel of expert judges at in-person finals simultaneously taking place at UCL and Harvard\\r\\nUniversity on Friday 5th and Saturday 6th April 2024.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winning teams will be awarded \xa310,000 (~$12.7k US), \xa36,000 (~$7.6k US) and \xa34,000 (~$5k US), respectively,\\r\\nand their research contributions have the potential to be deployed by Open Climate Fix to produce more accurate\\r\\nsolar power forecasts for the UK\u2019s National Grid Electricity System Operator.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the competition ran for the first time as ClimateHack.AI 2022 between January and March 2022, the winning model\\r\\nwas the most accurate model for predicting cloud movements that Open Climate Fix had seen to date.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Students
